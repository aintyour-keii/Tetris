Building Tetris in Python: Step-by-Step Guide
This README documents the process of recreating the classic game Tetris using Python and the Pygame library. The implementation includes all standard Tetris mechanics along with modern features like piece holding, ghost pieces, and wall kicks.

Prerequisites:
-Python 3.x
-Pygame library

Development Steps
1. Setting Up the Environment
Imported necessary libraries: pygame for graphics, random for generating random pieces, and time for timing functions
Defined game constants:
- Grid size (30 pixels per cell)
- Game dimensions (10 columns Ã— 20 rows)
- Screen dimensions with space for UI elements
- Grid offset to center the playing field
2. Defining Game Assets
Created color constants for UI elements and Tetris pieces
Defined timing parameters:
- Base drop speed (500ms)
- Minimum drop speed (100ms)
- Lock delay (500ms)
Defined the seven standard Tetris pieces (tetrominoes) as 2D arrays:
- I-piece (cyan)
- O-piece (yellow)
- T-piece (purple)
- S-piece (green)
- Z-piece (red)
- J-piece (blue)
- L-piece (orange)
3. Creating the Tetromino Class
Implemented a Tetrimono class with:
- Flexible constructor that can create pieces from:
    - A shape index
    - A provided shape and color
    - Random selection (default)
    - Starting position at the top center of the grid
    - Rotation method that performs 90-degree clockwise rotations
4. Implementing Core Game Mechanics
- Collision detection to prevent pieces from moving through walls, floor, or other pieces
- Wall kick system that tries alternative positions when rotation would cause a collision
- Block merging to add locked pieces to the grid
- Line clearing with scoring (100 points per line)
- Dynamic difficulty that increases drop speed based on score
5. Creating Visual Elements
- Grid drawing function to show cell boundaries
- Shadow (ghost piece) to show where the current piece would land
- Block drawing with 3D-like borders for visual appeal
- Preview displays for "next" and "hold" pieces
- Interactive button system with hover effects
6. Building Game Screens
Start screen with:
- Animated falling pieces in the background
- Game title with stroke effect
- Play button
- Control instructions
Game over screen with:
- Final score display
- Retry and quit options
7. Implementing Game Controls
- Left/Right arrows: Move piece horizontally
- Down arrow: Move piece down faster
- Up arrow: Rotate piece (with wall kick)
- Space: Instant drop
- C key: Hold current piece
8. Creating the Main Game Loop
Initialized Pygame and set up the game window
Created a reset_game function to initialize/reset the game state
Implemented the main game loop with:
- Time-based piece movement
- Event handling for user input
- Lock delay to allow last-moment adjustments
- Game state updates (piece locking, line clearing)
- Visual rendering of all game elements
- Game over detection
- Frame rate control (30 FPS)
9. Adding Advanced Features
Hold piece functionality to store a piece for later use
Lock delay that resets when the player moves or rotates a landed piece
Ghost piece to show where the current piece will land
Level system that increases speed as score increases
Instant drop with space bar
10. Polishing the User Experience
Animated title screen with visual effects
Clear control instructions
Visual feedback for button interactions
Game over screen with retry option
Score and level display during gameplay
